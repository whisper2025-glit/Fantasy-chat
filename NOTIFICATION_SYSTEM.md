# üîî Notification System Implementation

A comprehensive notification system that automatically sends users notifications when they receive new followers, when their bots are favorited/liked, or when they receive comments and reviews.

## ‚ú® Features

- **New Follower Notifications** - Get notified when someone follows you
- **Bot Favorited Notifications** - Know when users add your bots to their favorites
- **Bot Liked Notifications** - Receive alerts when users like your characters
- **Comment Notifications** - Get notified of new comments on your bots
- **Review Notifications** - Be alerted when users review your characters
- **Real-time Updates** - Notifications appear instantly without page refresh
- **Persistent Storage** - Notifications are saved in localStorage
- **Categorization** - Notifications are organized by type (followers, favorites, etc.)
- **Demo Mode** - Test all notification types with built-in demo component

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`lib/notification-triggers.ts`** - Main trigger system
   - `triggerFollowerNotification()` - For new followers
   - `triggerBotFavoritedNotification()` - For bot favorites
   - `triggerBotLikedNotification()` - For bot likes
   - `triggerBotCommentNotification()` - For comments
   - `triggerBotReviewNotification()` - For reviews
   - `IntegrationHelpers` - Easy integration functions for components

2. **`lib/notification-service.ts`** - Service orchestration
   - Singleton service that manages all notification functionality
   - Initializes simulations and event listeners
   - Provides cleanup and status checking

3. **`lib/notifications-storage.ts`** - Data management (existing, extended)
   - Handles notification storage and retrieval
   - Provides filtering and statistics
   - Manages real-time updates

4. **`components/notification-demo.tsx`** - Testing interface
   - Floating demo component for testing all notification types
   - Shows service status and provides manual triggers

## üöÄ Usage

### Automatic Integration

The system is automatically initialized in `app/page.tsx` and will start generating simulated notifications. Real notifications are triggered when users interact with your components.

### Manual Triggers

You can trigger notifications manually using the `IntegrationHelpers`:

\`\`\`typescript
import { IntegrationHelpers } from "@/lib/notification-triggers";

// When someone favorites a character
IntegrationHelpers.onCharacterFavorited(
  characterId,
  characterName,
  userName,
  userAvatar,
);

// When someone likes a character
IntegrationHelpers.onCharacterLiked(
  characterId,
  characterName,
  userName,
  userAvatar,
);

// When someone comments
IntegrationHelpers.onCharacterCommented(
  characterId,
  characterName,
  userName,
  comment,
  userAvatar,
);

// When someone reviews
IntegrationHelpers.onCharacterReviewed(
  characterId,
  characterName,
  userName,
  review,
  rating, // "up" | "down" | "neutral"
  userAvatar,
);

// When someone follows you
IntegrationHelpers.onUserFollowed(
  followerUsername,
  followeeUsername,
  followerAvatar,
);
\`\`\`

### Component Integration

The system is already integrated into:

- **Bot Profile Page** (`components/bot-profile-page.tsx`)
  - Triggers notifications for favorites, follows, and reviews
- **Character Card** (`components/character/character-card.tsx`)
  - Triggers notifications when characters are favorited

## üéÆ Testing

### Demo Component

A floating demo button appears in the bottom-right corner that allows you to:

- Test each notification type manually
- View service status
- Trigger sample notifications instantly

### Simulated Notifications

The system automatically generates realistic simulated notifications every 15-45 seconds, including:

- Random follower notifications
- Bot interaction notifications (favorites, likes, comments, reviews)
- Varied usernames and character names for realism

## üì± User Experience

### Notification Display

- Notifications appear in the **Notifications page** (`components/notifications-page.tsx`)
- Badge counter in header shows unread notification count
- Notifications are categorized into:
  - **Official** - System and platform notifications
  - **General** - User interaction notifications
- Filter by type: All, Comments, Followers, Favorites, Likes

### Real-time Updates

- New notifications trigger badge updates immediately
- Custom events allow components to react to new notifications
- No page refresh required for notification updates

## üîß Technical Details

### Event System

The system uses custom DOM events for real-time communication:

- `newFollower` - Dispatched when someone follows
- `botFavorited` - Dispatched when bot is favorited
- `botLiked` - Dispatched when bot is liked
- `botCommented` - Dispatched when bot receives comment
- `botReviewed` - Dispatched when bot is reviewed
- `notificationsUpdated` - Dispatched when notification list changes

### Data Structure

\`\`\`typescript
interface Notification {
  id: string;
  type: "official" | "general";
  category: "all" | "comments" | "followers" | "favorites" | "likes";
  title: string;
  content: string;
  sender: string;
  senderAvatar?: string;
  timestamp: number;
  isRead: boolean;
}
\`\`\`

### Storage

- Notifications are stored in `localStorage` under the `"notifications"` key
- Automatic persistence and retrieval
- Cross-tab synchronization via storage events

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Notification Types

1. Add new category to the `Notification` interface
2. Create trigger function in `notification-triggers.ts`
3. Add to `IntegrationHelpers` for easy access
4. Integrate into relevant components

### Styling

- All components use theme-aware Tailwind classes
- Notifications respect light/dark mode
- Consistent with existing design system

### Simulation Configuration

Modify simulation behavior in `notification-service.ts`:

- Change frequency (currently every 20 seconds)
- Add new sample data (usernames, bot names, comments)
- Adjust probability rates

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production use:

1. **Replace simulated data** with real user data from your backend
2. **Connect to authentication system** to get actual usernames/avatars
3. **Set up real-time backend notifications** via WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
4. **Disable demo component** by removing `<NotificationDemo />` from `app/page.tsx`
5. **Configure notification preferences** via user settings

## üìä Analytics

The system provides notification statistics:

- Total notifications
- Unread count
- Breakdown by type (official vs general)
- Category distribution

Access via `getNotificationStats()` or the notification service.
